 * Who can register and what the default role will be

 *      admin == members must be registered by an administrator
 *      root  == only the root user can register members
 * 
 * Values for default role can be any valid role, but it's hard to see why
 * the default 'member' value should be changed under the standard setup.
 * However, additional roles can be added and so there's nothing stopping
 * anyone from defining a different default.
