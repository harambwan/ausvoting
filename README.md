# ausvoting
Our platform, Australia Votes, bridges the gap between the needs of modern elections and the digital space. Using innovative technology, secure infrastructure design and robust threat mitigation strategies our talented team, largely consisting of Cyber Security professionals, have developed the secure and reliable online voting system that Australia needs.

Our system accurately records, and securely stores voting data anonymously in a distributed blockchain-based network which ensures availability and immutability throughout the voting process. It is extremely easy to scale, whether it be a local council election or a federal election to decide the future of our nation, by simply deploying more instances of the server image.

Our final product can be seen at https://ausvoting.ddns.net/

To give it a test drive, browse to https://ausvoting.ddns.net/register.php and create an account to log in with. (The actual product assumes that accounts are pre-registered according to real people's identities, therefore there are no links to it but for the purpose of this demo I included the function for you to create your own).
